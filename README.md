## Description

From a list of 5 fruits, the computer selects one at random - this is done using the choice method of Python's random module. The user is then asked to guess a letter, and the program checks to ensure the input is valid by checking both that the length = 1 and that the input is alphabetical using the isalpha() method. That's it so far - will update again as it evolves but that is surely enough excitement for now.
